# Agent Landscape 

Holistic view on the current Generative AI application landscape including products, companies, use cases, investors and technologies related to AI agents. 

## Structure

- `app.js` - embedded datasource and helper functions for visualization and searches for direct connection and most relevant paths.
- `js` - JS files for visualization of the data graph.
- `data.json` - Dataset file read by `app.js` for visualization.
- `show.sh` - The simplest local HTTP server to run the application on your system ( this can be modified to any other server )
